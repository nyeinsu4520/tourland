        <h1>Information</h1>

    <div class="info-section">
        <h2>Passports & Visas</h2>
        <p>A valid passport and an entry visa are required for all visitors. A tourist visa allows a stay of 4 weeks, extendible by an additional 14 days. A business visa allows a stay of 10 weeks, extendible from 3-12 months on a case-by-case basis. If the visa expires by a day or two, a fee of three dollars per day can be paid.</p>
        <p>Please check the Tourist eVisa for more details.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="info-section">
        <h2>Entry Visa Formalities</h2>
        <p>Visas can be obtained through local tour operators. Complete personal data is required two weeks in advance. We need a scanned passport and flight details. Once we receive these, we will apply for the arrival visa and send a letter to airlines. Passengers need to bring this letter to Myanmar for presentation at the transit counter. Two passport-sized photos are required for the visa, which is valid for four weeks.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="info-section">
        <h2>Customs</h2>
        <p>Foreign currencies, jewelry, electrical goods, and video cameras must be declared at the airport. Duty-free allowance includes: Two bottles of liquor, two cartons of cigarettes, 100 cigars, 1.5 lbs of tobacco, and one pint of perfume or eau de cologne.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="info-section">
        <h2>Pre-Departure Preparations</h2>
        <p>It is advisable to have travel insurance covering theft, loss, and medical issues. Recommended items include: Pain relievers, antibiotics, calamine lotion, stomach medication, bandages, insect repellent, sunscreen, chap-stick, and water purification tablets.</p>

        <h2>Exchange</h2>
        <p>Currency can be exchanged at banks or Yangon airport. US Dollars and Euros are widely accepted. Ensure that US Dollar bills are in good condition. Do not change large amounts if you have already bought a package tour as US Dollars are accepted at most places.</p>

        <p>Credit cards and travelers cheques are mostly not accepted. Some upscale restaurants and hotels accept credit cards with a 3% charge.

    <div class="info-section">
        <h2>Gems / Precious Stones</h2>
        <p>Myanmar is known for rubies and jade. Purchases should be made with caution. Guides do not recommend specific shops, and buyers are responsible for their own judgments. Ensure you get an official receipt and certificate from licensed dealers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="info-section">
        <h2>Insurance</h2>
        <p>Medical facilities are limited, with Yangon having the best facilities. It is crucial to have medical insurance covering evacuation flights if necessary. Adventure tours require proof of insurance.</p>

    <div class="info-section">
        <h2>Clothing</h2>
        <p>Wear lightweight, natural fabrics like cotton. Cover arms and legs in the evenings to avoid insect bites. Bring a raincoat or umbrella for the rainy season, and warm clothing for cooler evenings in certain areas. Dress modestly when visiting pagodas and monasteries.</p>
